# 📧 Email Spam Classifier — Project P-0

Welcome to **P-0**, a project where we build, train, and deploy a Machine Learning model that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**.  
This project showcases a full end-to-end pipeline — from **data preprocessing** to **model deployment** using **Streamlit**!

## 📋 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a given email content is **Spam** or **Ham**.  
It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to transform the raw email text and applies machine learning algorithms for prediction.

Our goals:
- Demonstrate a real-world ML application.
- Deploy the model to make it publicly accessible.
- Build a clean, minimalistic, and functional user interface.

## 🧩 Step-by-Step What We Did

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Used a public **spam.csv** dataset containing labeled emails (spam/ham).
   - Cleaned the data: removed nulls, standardized labels.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Converted email text into numerical format using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier — ideal for text classification tasks.
   - Tuned and evaluated model performance (achieved high precision and accuracy).

4. **Model Saving**
   - Serialized the trained model and vectorizer using **Joblib** for future use.

5. **Building the Web App**
   - Designed an interactive UI with **Streamlit**.
   - Custom theme, user-friendly messages, proper error handling.

6. **Deployment**
   - Deployed the project on **Streamlit Cloud**.
   - Reorganized project structure for deployment compatibility (moved `streamlit_app.py` to root).

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions (For Local Run)

> **Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xAyushman/P-0.git
   cd P-0
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate    # For Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## ✨ Future Enhancements

✅ **Make a Chrome Extension**  
   - Integrate the model inside Gmail to detect spam in real-time.

✅ **API Creation**  
   - Build a FastAPI/Flask-based backend API to serve predictions.

✅ **Better NLP Models**  
   - Upgrade from TF-IDF + Naive Bayes to modern transformers (BERT, DistilBERT).

✅ **Automated Email Scanning**  
   - Allow users to scan full inboxes for spam predictions.

✅ **UI/UX Improvements**  
   - Add upload options for `.txt` files, prediction history, and better mobile responsiveness.
